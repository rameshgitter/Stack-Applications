# Stack-Applications
## 1. Simulate the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion and understand the process for number of disks --> 1, 2, 3 and 4.
## 2. Develop a subroutine that evaluates a postfix expression using Stack.
  Phase-1: Provide support only for single digit operand\
  Phase-2: Provide the support for multi-digits operand\
  Phase-3: Do necessary changes to provide support to evaluate a prefix expression.
## 3. Subroutine that converts an infix expression to postfix expression using Stack.
Phase-1: Only support following operators --> +, -, *, / \
Phase-2: Also support additional operators --> (, ), ^ \
Phase-3: Provide the support for multi-digits operand \
Phase-4: Do necessary changes to provide support to convert infix expression to prefix expression.

Note: Use your existing array based integer stack APIs to develop these subroutines.
